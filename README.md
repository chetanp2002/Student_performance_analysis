## Introduction
The **Student Performance Analysis** project explores the relationships between different factors and student performance. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights into how different factors such as gender, parental education level, and test preparation impact student success.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes information on:
- **Student demographics** (age, gender, parental education)
- **Academic performance** (math, reading, and writing scores)
- **Study habits** (test preparation, study time, etc.)

The data was cleaned and prepared before analysis to ensure accuracy.

## Technologies
This project was created using the following technologies:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration

## Analysis
Key areas of analysis include:
- Impact of parental education on student performance
- Gender-based performance differences
- Correlation between study habits and scores
- Identification of key factors influencing student success

Visualizations and statistical models are used to support findings.

## How to Use
To explore the analysis:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb) to view the code, analysis, and visualizations.
4. Run the notebook or scripts in your local Python environment.
